# elden-agent

Live agent for helping you play Elden Ring, giving tips, tricks, and controls while you play.

This needs to be used in conjunction with a frontend like the [agents playground](https://agents-playground.livekit.io/) to actually feed the agent the audio and video data from your machine. 

The most reliable way to stream video data is by using a virtual camera like the one in [OBS](https://obsproject.com/kb/virtual-camera-guide) rather than screen sharing. It's generally much more stable.
